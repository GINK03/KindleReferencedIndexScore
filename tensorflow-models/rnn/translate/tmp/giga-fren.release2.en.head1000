Astronomers Introduction Introduction video What is Astronomy?
Often considered the oldest science, it was born of our amazement at the sky and our need to question Astronomy is the science of space beyond Earth’s atmosphere.
The name is derived from the Greek root astron for star, and nomos for arrangement or law.
Astronomy is concerned with celestial objects and phenomena – like stars, planets, comets and galaxies – as well as the large-scale properties of the Universe, also known as "The Big Picture".
More specifically, astronomy is the study of the origin and evolution of the Universe, the physics and chemistry of celestial objects, and the calculation of their positions and motions.
For most people, astronomy represents a world that is both mysterious and grandiose – a story about glimmering celestial objects and the immensity of the cosmos.
It prompts us to ask the deepest existential questions:
Who are we?
Where did we come from?
Are we alone?
The lure of these universal enigmas was the spark that ignited the passion of many of today’s famous astronomers.
Astronomy also plays a much more practical role that is not nearly as important today as it was in the past.
Since the time of our earliest ancestors, humans have used the motions of celestial objects to position themselves in space and time.
Prehistoric humans studied the relationship between the seasons and the length of days to plan their hunting and gathering activities.
It was also by observing the positions of the stars that the first farmers decided when to plant and when to harvest, and early navigators could sail the oceans blue.
In the Age of Antiquity, astrometry – the measurement of the positions of stars and planets – was the main occupation of astronomers.
There was some degree of interest for astronomy from the general public as well, since they believed that the positions of celestial objects influenced events that took place on Earth.
 During the Renaissance, advances in mathematics coupled with the invention of new observational instruments (like the refracting telescope) gave rise to modern astronomy.
From the 19th century onwards, the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum and the world of the atom spurred on the development of astrophysics, a new discipline in astronomy that is now considered to be the most important.
Today, astronomy covers several disciplines:
◦ Astrometry, which is the precise measurement of the position of stars and planets, and which is greatly facilitated by the use of modern CCD cameras and computers
◦ Stellar astronomy, which is the study of the origins and evolution of stars
◦ Galactic astronomy, which studies the structure and components of galaxies
◦ Astrophysics, which studies the Universe and the physics of its constituents (luminosity, temperature, chemical composition)
◦ Cosmology, which studies the origin and evolution of the Universe as a whole Related to these fields of research are two disciplines that lie more within the domain of geologists and biologists: planetary science, which is the study of asteroids, comets and planets, and astrobiology, which studies the possibility of life in the Universe.
Nowadays, professional astronomers have a strong background in astrophysics and their observations are almost always examined in an astrophysical context.
The most serious amateurs actively participate in the study of variable stars, the discovery of new asteroids or comets, and other exciting astronomical work.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first astronomical observations in Canada The era of explorers and Jesuits The history of Canadian astronomy began when the first European explorers used astronomical observations to guide them over the ocean and to navigate our waterways.
John Cabot, who discovered Newfoundland in 1497, and Jacques Cartier, who explored further inland by way of the Saint-Lawrence River in 1534, were undoubtedly the first explorers that used astronomical instruments to locate the landmass now known as Canada.
It was also during the Champlain era that French missionaries, the Jesuits, first set foot on Canadian soil in 1604.
By 1618, they had begun to record astronomical observations (most notably about comets and eclipses) and included them in the reports sent back to France (titled Relations in French).
In 1634, astronomy officially became a part of the tasks assigned to Jean Bourdon, the Engineer-in-Chief and Land Surveyor for the New France colony in Quebec.
During the time of the early settlers, the function of astronomy was primarily practical.
It was the science of colonization par excellence, used to draw up accurate geographic maps and to tell time precisely.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first observatories The first astronomical observatory in North America was Canadian It is difficult to confirm with certainty the very first astronomical observatory in Canada.
The Jesuit priest Joseph-Pierre de Bonnécamps, who taught at the College of Quebec from 1750 to 1759, had obtained a number of astronomical instruments with the intention of constructing an observatory on the college roof.
Bonnécamps left Canada in 1759 not long before the fall of Quebec at the hands of the British, and he never returned.
The British closed the College of Quebec and the teaching tasks were transferred to the Seminary of Quebec across the street.
There is mention of an "observation chamber" in the Seminary archives of 1770, which may be a reference to the existence of an astronomical observatory.
Evidence for another early observatory can be found in a wood engraving from a book by the Marquis de Chabert de Cogolin that dates from the time he was at the Fortress of Louisbourg (1750-1751).
Chabert owned several such instruments and it is likely that a temporary observatory existed for a short time in the fortress.
The first North American observatory that existed with historical certainty was at Castle Frederick, the estate founded by Joseph DesBarres at Falmouth, Nova Scotia, in 1765.
Later records describe an observatory on Quebec’s Île Jésus (now "Laval") that was established by Dr. Charles Smallwood de Saint-Martin.
Historical evidence suggests that it was already in existence by 1846.
There is also evidence that in 1849, Dr. James Toldervy of Fredericton, New Brunswick, created an observatory in his garden near the Saint John River.
A year later, in 1850, the Quebec City Observatory was established on the Plains of Abraham.
Built in such a way as to be visible from the port and the Saint Lawrence River, the structure included a large ball that signalled midday when it dropped.
Historical records report the establishment of seven other major observatories from 1850 to the end of the century.
They are: 1.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Observatory The first government observatory and provider of official time in Canada The Dominion Observatory was founded in 1905 in Ottawa, Ontario.
The impetus for Canada’s first government observatory came from the Geological Survey of Canada, which had a pressing need for a service that could supply precise temporal and spatial coordinates for its mapping and topographic surveys.
In those days, only observatories were capable of providing such a service.
William Frederick King, Chief Astronomer for the Department of the Interior, played a key role in setting up the new observatory.
He became its first Director and equipped it with a 35-centimetre telescope, the largest ever installed in Canada.
The first mandate of the observatory was to determine and distribute the exact time to the rest of the country.
King confided this task to Robert Meldrum Stewart, the astronomer who went on to become Director from 1923 to 1946.
More specifically, it was necessary to know the exact moment when certain stars passed their highest point in the sky (the meridian); these were known as "transit times".
Due to the conscientious observation of transit times for many stars, and to the acquisition of a high precision clock in 1929, Stewart gradually established a network of clocks throughout Ottawa’s federal government buildings.
A signal from the observatory’s clock was electronically transmitted to the buildings; in this way, about 700 clocks in Ottawa were able to display precise time by 1930.
After 1941, this time service was extended to the entire country and the Dominion Observatory became the official supplier of time for Canada.
In order to fulfill its second mandate – to provide spatial coordinates for the country – the Dominion Observatory set out to determine the precise position of 3,162 stars in the sky.
This was accomplished by recording 28,000 astronomical observations from 1911 to 1923.
A new project was launched in 1923, and the positions of another 1,368 stars were measured until 1950.
These data – combined with the knowledge of exact time – allowed longitude, latitude and elevation to be calculated with precision for many points across Canada.
As part of its responsibility to the Geological Survey of Canada, the Dominion Observatory was also entrusted with a third mandate: to collect seismic, gravimetric and magnetic geophysical data.
Among the noteworthy events that marked the history of the Dominion Observatory were the apparent discovery of "Planet X" in 1928, the determination of the solar rotation as a function of latitude in the 1930’s, and the discovery of numerous meteor impact sites in Canada.
Scientific institutions in Canada were reorganized in 1970 and the responsibilities of the Dominion Observatory were transferred to the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).
The observatory ceased its activities and the building became the headquarters for the NRC.
In 1974, the telescope was moved to the Helen Sawyer Hogg Observatory of the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology where it remains to this day.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory The first Canadian observatory of international calibre, it once housed the largest telescope in the world The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1918 at Saanich near Victoria, British Columbia.
Its creation was motivated by the growing need of Canadian astronomers to have access to a large world-class telescope.
The observatory immediately achieved international status by housing a 1.83-metre telescope that was the largest operating telescope in the world, although it only held this title for a few months.
The installation of the telescope was largely the work of celebrated Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett, and the instrument was baptized the "Plaskett Telescope" in his honour.
It measured 15 metres long and its mobile parts weighed 42 tonnes.
Plaskett became the first Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and helped it establish an international research reputation very early on.
In 1922, for example, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star.
This celestial body bears the name of "Plaskett’s Star" in his honour.
During subsequent years, Plaskett established the radial velocities of several stars (that is, the speed at which the stars are moving away or toward the observer) and demonstrated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is rotating.
He was also the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 the distance from the centre of our galaxy to its edge, and that our solar system takes approximately 22 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
In 1940, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was the site of two other major discoveries.
Andrew McKellar, one of the observatory’s astronomers, became the first researcher to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectral bands for the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
One year later, in 1941, he determined the temperature of the cyanogen molecules and deduced that the interstellar environment in which they are found is very cold, approximately -270 °C.
It was the first direct measurement of the temperature of the Universe.
In 1962, the observatory acquired a second telescope measuring 1.22 metres in diameter.
Equipped with only a spectroscope, it was mainly used to study binary stars.
In 1970, the responsibility of the observatory was conferred to the National Research Council of Canada.
In 1981, the observatory received a third telescope measuring 40 centimetres across.
It was primarily used for scientific research, notably the study of gas clouds in our galaxy (the Milky Way), and to test instruments destined for large telescopes.
Today it is used to show the sky to the general public.
In 1995, the observatory became the headquarters for the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, which operates several telescopes (optical and radio) in Canada and shares many others with various countries elsewhere in the world, including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Gemini telescopes.
In 2001, the observatory inaugurated an interpretation centre open to the general public all year long and affectionately named "The Centre of the Universe".
It includes a small planetarium and offers interactive displays, multimedia presentations and special events designed to introduce people from all walks of life to the world of astronomy.
Over the years, new instruments were added and many technical improvements were made to the Plaskett Telescope, the observatory’s main telescope.
Today, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory is the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The David Dunlap Observatory Home to the largest optical telescope in Canada The David Dunlap Observatory opened its doors in 1935 near the small town of Richmond Hill, 25 kilometres north of Toronto, Ontario.
The facility was the property of the University of Toronto and was operated by the astronomy department.
It was created to conduct astronomical research, to assist in the advanced education of university students, and to stimulate the public’s interest in astronomy.
The observatory was mainly the work of Clarence Augustus Chant, a Canadian astronomer and astronomy professor at the University of Toronto.
In 1921, while campaigning to establish a large telescope observatory in the Toronto region, Chant managed to get David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, interested in the project.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924, but his widow, Jessie, took up the cause and worked for the next ten years with Chant to make sure the project succeeded.
The observatory was inaugurated the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed a 1.88-metre telescope, the second largest in the world after the Mount Wilson telescope in the United States, and Canada thus owned two of the four largest telescopes in the world.
The building that houses the administrative offices of the observatory was also inaugurated in 1935.
Over the years, more and more radio astronomers were joining the astronomy department at the University of Toronto, and in the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory actively participated in the development of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario.
By the end of the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory, being located near the major urban centre of Toronto, found itself plagued with the problem of light pollution.
The observatory responded in 1971 by erecting a 60-centimetre telescope at Las Campanas in Chile.
The David Dunlap Observatory thus acquired international status and the skies of the south were available to Canadian astronomers for the first time.
A spectacular discovery was made at the David Dunlap Observatory in 1972.
Charles Thomas Bolton, one of the observatory’s astronomers, discovered Cygnus X-1, the first black hole ever identified.
In 1987, the observatory was responsible for another amazing discovery thanks to its telescope in Las Campanas.
Ian Shelton, one of the astronomers from the University of Toronto, was using the Chilean telescope when he observed a supernova (1987 A) in the Greater Magellan could.
The discovery made headlines around the world, as it was the first supernova visible to the unaided eye in almost 400 years.
Unfortunately, financial problems forced the David Dunlap Observatory to cease operations at Las Campanas in 1997.
The National Observatory of Argentina took charge of the telescope and moved it from Chile to Parque El Leoncito in Argentina.
The David Dunlap Observatory nonetheless retains one quarter of the observation time at the telescope.
Today, the David Dunlap Observatory of Toronto is still active thanks in part to a light pollution abatement program initiated by Charles Thomas Bolton.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Algonquin Radio Observatory Home to the largest parabolic antenna in Canada The Algonquin Radio Observatory was inaugurated in 1959 at Traverse Lake in the Algonquin National Park in Ontario.
It was created by the National Research Council of Canada for Canadian radio astronomers who needed a site in Ontario where radio interference would be minimal.
The first director was Arthur Edwin Covington, Canada’s first radio astronomer.
More than a decade earlier, in 1946, Covington had collected data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) from a site in Ottawa, and again in 1947 from Goth Hill south of Ottawa.
His work became of paramount importance when he demonstrated that the intensity of solar radiation was related to the Sun’s magnetic activity, which had (and still has) crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems and power lines.
The Traverse Lake site in Algonquin National Park was selected for the Algonquin Radio Observatory due to its relative isolation from manmade interference.
Covington installed a parabolic mirror with a diameter of 1.83 metres in 1960 and began moving his equipment from Goth Hill in 1962.
The radio telescopes operated continuously at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres, which is an ideal wavelength for monitoring solar activity due to the Sun’s particular chemical composition.
In 1966, an array consisting of 32 parabolic antennas, each 3 metres in diameter, was added to the observatory.
The goal was to refine the measurements from other radio telescopes by scanning the Sun’s surface every noon at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres.
Operating at a wavelength of 2 centimetres, it was used to study galactic and extragalactic objects that emit radio waves, such as quasars.
In 1968, the 46-metre radio telescope was used in conjunction with the 26-metre instrument at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory of Penticton, British Columbia, to simulate the resolution of a giant 3,074-kilometre radio telescope (the physical distance separating the two instruments).
It was the first successful long distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
The goal of the experiment was to discern a source of radio waves with great precision.
Very large antennas are necessary to precisely determine the position of radio sources because radio waves have much larger wavelengths than visible light waves, and because the detection of any object in space depends largely on the size of the observation instrument (that is, its lenses, mirrors or radio antennas).
The 1970’s marked a time of increased collaboration between the Algonquin Observatory radio astronomers and the researchers at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Many new complex chemical compounds were identified for the first time in interstellar gas clouds thanks to the collaborative effort.
After planning to resurface the 46-metre radio telescope so that it could operate at wavelengths as small as 3 millimetres, the National Research Council of Canada decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987 and purchase a 25% share in the new James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory, which would include a radio telescope that could operate at 0.3 to 2 millimetres.
In 1990, the work of collecting data on the Sun’s radio flux moved to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1991, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was finally closed, but the 46-metre antenna is nonetheless still active as part of a continental network of antennas that precisely measures movements of the North American tectonic plate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory The largest radio astronomy observatory in Canada The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1960 at White Lake near Penticton, British Columbia.
The creation of the observatory was primarily the work of Carlyle Smith Beals, an astronomer who wanted to advance the field of astrophysics in Canada.
The first parabolic antenna, measuring 25.6 metres, began operating in 1960.
It was mainly designed to operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Radio astronomers at Penticton have been striving towards this goal since the first days of the observatory.
In 1962, a second radio telescope was put in place.
Fully operational in 1964, it consisted of 1,700 cedar posts that extended for 1.3 kilometres in the shape of a "T" to cover a surface area of 65,000 square metres.
The posts supported a network of several thousand metres of metallic wires formed the antenna of the radio telescope.
This radio telescope was primarily used between 1965 and 1969 during a period when solar spots were at a minimum.
In fact, it is only during these periods of low solar activity that very long radio waves from space can pass through the atmosphere to reach Earth’s surface.
The main goal of the T-shaped radio telescope at Penticton was to produce a map of radio sources in our galaxy.
It was also used to observe several hundred specific radio sources, such as quasars and distant galaxies.
In 1965, a 1.8-metre parabolic antenna was installed to collect data on solar radiation.
In 1968, the 25.6-metre radio telescope at Penticton was used in conjunction with the 46-metre telescope at the Algonquin Radio Observatory to simulate the resolution of a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres (the physical distance between the two instruments).
The antennas would operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Today, the synthesis array radio telescope consists of seven 8.5-metre parabolic antennas that can operate continuously, 24 hours a day, at two wavelengths (21 and 74 centimetres).
From 1995 to 2005, the radio telescope was mainly used in the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the goal of which is to map a large portion of the Milky Way.
In 1990, following the closure of the Algonquin Radio Observatory, the task of gathering data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) was transferred to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton.
The observatory is now under the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory An example of a successful partnership The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1972 at Priddis, a small locality 75 kilometres southwest of Calgary, Alberta.
Belonging to the University of Calgary, the facility was operated by the astronomy and physics departments.
The objectives the observatory were the advanced education of university students and the pursuit of astronomical research.
In 1970, Alexander Rothney Cross, a wealthy rancher, donated land to the University of Calgary for the purpose of constructing the observatory.
Work commenced in 1971 and the university took the opportunity to simultaneously start an undergraduate degree in astronomy.
The observatory opened its doors in 1972 to display a dome housing a 41-centimetre telescope, and an adjacent lecture room.
The first research activities were mostly on photometry.
The year of 1981 was particularly fruitful for the observatory.
The National Research Council of Canada decided to finance the construction of a new facility that would house a 1.5-metre telescope capable of operating in the infrared range.
Alexander Rothney Cross signed on to the project by making another donation.
The Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake also provided a gift: a Baker-Nunn camera that the Armed Forces had used to track satellites in the sky.
The new facility was constructed by the physics department of the University of Calgary.
Construction continued for several years and by 1987 the 1.5-metre telescope was operational.
The physics department changed its name to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
Most of the research work focused on the study of stars, X-ray sources, possible black holes and planetary nebulas.
The telescope was still equipped with a metal mirror (not glass), and its optical qualities were considered less than optimal by that time.
The decision was made at the end of the 1980’s to replace it with a new 1.8-metre mirror.
The new mirror was delivered to the observatory in 1993, and once again, Alexander Rothney Cross contributed to the project.
Construction was completed by the workshop of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the telescope became operational in 1996.
The following year, it was baptized as the Alexander Rothney Cross Telescope in honour of the generous benefactor.
The new telescope is used to observe (among other things) gravitational lenses, asteroids, comets and variable stars, and is also used in the search for planets outside our solar system.
Recent developments include a new Visitor’s Centre that was inaugurated in 2003.
The 41-centimetre telescope continues to be operational and is used to track asteroids that orbit near Earth and represent a possible danger.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Mont-Mégantic Observatory The largest astronomical observatory in eastern North America The Mont-Mégantic Observatory was opened in 1978 near Sherbrooke, Quebec.
It was created to promote university-level astronomy education in Quebec, to provide qualified astronomers with state of the art research equipment, and to promote astronomy among French Canadian citizens.
The telescope is equipped with a 1.6-metre mirror that weights one metric ton; the entire structure weighs 24 tonnes.
The Mont-Mégantic Observatory houses the largest telescope in eastern North America, and the fourth largest in Canada after those of the David Dunlap Observatory in Toronto (1.88 metres), the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria (1.83 metres), and the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (1.8 metres).
Although not the biggest, the state of the art instruments attached to the Mont-Mégantic telescope make it the most powerful telescope in Canada.
The project to construct a large observatory in Quebec was launched in 1971 by professors Gilles Beaudet and George Michaud of the University of Montreal.
Laval University in Quebec City joined the venture in 1974 and a partnership agreement was signed in 1975.
The federal and provincial governments approved the project in 1976, and construction started the same year.
The service building was completed in 1977, and the observatory several months later in 1978.
René Racine joined the project in 1973 and became Director in 1976, the same year he left the University of Toronto to work at the University of Montreal.
A dynamic instrument program also accounts for a large part of Mégantic’s productivity.
In 1991, for example, the observatory became the first in Canada to use an infrared camera.
Named MONICA (for MONtreal Infrared Camera), it was designed by Daniel Nadeau and René Doyon of the University of Montreal.
The site at Mont-Mégantic is particularly favourable for infrared astronomy because interference radiation levels are very low during the long cold nights in winter (sometimes even lower than the levels at Mauna Kea in Hawaii).
In 1996, the Mont-Mégantic ASTROLab, an astronomy activity centre, opened its doors to the general public.
The centre hosts interactive displays, a high definition movie, multimedia presentations and access to two public observatories during open house astronomy evenings.
Visitors can also tour the observatory and its 1.6-metre telescope during the day.
In 1999, a major 3-year renovation program was started.
First, the dome of the 1.6-metre telescope was repaired and equipped with a ventilation system.
Then, in 2000, the observatory was linked to universities by fibre optics.
A year later, the telescope controls became fully computerized and a new bonnet (the interface that allows instruments to be coupled to the telescope) was installed.
Following this, a number of new state of the art instruments were also added to the telescope.
Asteroid 4843 is named in honour of the observatory.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory One of the most powerful and productive observatories in the world The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory began operating in 1979 atop the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
Canada’s participation meant valuable access to a world-class telescope for Canadian astronomers.
At the time of its inauguration, the 3.6-metre telescope was the sixth largest in the world and operated in the range of visible light and infrared.
France launched the project in 1970 with the purchase of a 14-tonne glass disk.
The state of Hawaii joined the project in 1971, followed by Canada in 1973.
The three partners signed an agreement in 1974 and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation was born.
Canada was in charge of polishing the mirror, putting into place a control system for the telescope, and constructing the observatory building.
France was responsible for constructing specific mechanical parts for the telescope (tube, frame, etc.), and Hawaii provided the site, a road to the site, and several instruments.
The telescope’s mobile component weighed 250 tonnes and the total structure weighed 325 tonnes.
In 1977, the headquarters and a library were set up at Waimea near the observatory.
Canada was granted access to 42.5% of the available observation time, France 42.5%, and the United States 15%.
In 1996, an adaptive optics system was installed on the telescope that would once again rival the Hubble Space Telescope in the production of the highest resolution astronomical images.
These new improvements quickly bore fruit for the Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory as it was involved in discovering – or confirming the discovery of – many new moons, gravitational lenses, and so on.
For example, astronomers Brett J. Gladman and John J. Kavelaars discovered three new satellites around the planet Uranus in 1999 (Prospero, Setebos, and Stephano) and eight around Saturn in 2000 (Siarnaq, Tarvos, Ijrak, Thrymr, Skathi, Mundilfari, Erriapo and Suttungr).
The discoveries of other moons around Uranus and Neptune were announced in 2001 and 2002, but have not yet been confirmed.
In 2003, a new imaging system known as MegaPrime was installed.
MegaPrime uses the French-designed MegaCam camera that is able to take 340-million pixel images (about 18,400 x 18,400 pixels), making it the most powerful camera of its type in the world.
These days, the observatory is involved in the study of the solar system, the birth and evolution of stars, the interstellar medium, the structure and content of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and large-scale structures of the Universe.
The Canadian participation in the observatory is managed by the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory The largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory was inaugurated in 1987 near the summit of Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
The observatory is named after James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist who was famous for his groundbreaking work in electricity and magnetism.
At the time of the observatory’s construction, the National Research Council of Canada was planning to resurface its 46-metre radio telescope at the Algonquin Radio Astronomy Observatory.
The goal of the resurfacing program was to increase the resolution of the telescope so that it could observe wavelengths as small as three millimetres.
Upon learning of the capabilities of the new British-Dutch radio telescope, the Council decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987and to purchase a 25% share in the James-Clerk-Maxwell Telescope.
The JCMT would suit the needs of Canadian astronomers because it was to operate at wavelengths in the submillimetre to lower microwave range (between 0.3 to 2 millimetres).
Canada currently has access to 22.5% of observation time, the United Kingdom 49.5%, the Netherlands 18%, and the international community 10%.
A piece of Gore-TexTM (the largest in the world) is permanently attached to the building’s opening, which protects the telescope from wind and dust but still allows it to "see" the sky.
Gore-Tex allows 97% of submillimetre waves to pass through and does not interfere with the operation of the radio telescope.
The number one enemy of a radio telescope is water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere because it easily absorbs submillimetre waves.
To minimize this effect, the observatory is located at an elevation of 4,092 metres: 97% of atmospheric water vapour exists below this elevation and thus below the observatory.
The main use of radio telescopes is to study our solar system (the Sun, planets and comets), interstellar matter, distant galaxies, quasars, and cosmic background radiation.
The government organization responsible for Canadian participation in the radio telescope is the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory Perfecting the next generation of super telescopes The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory was established in 1995 at Maple Ridge, approximately 60 kilometres east of Vancouver.
The goal of the observatory is to develop and test new liquid mirror telescopes.
Liquid mirror telescopes are part of the next generation of super telescopes.
A liquid mirror is made of a strongly reflective liquid (like mercury, for example) that rotates so that its surface curves and takes the shape of a paraboloid, which will direct and concentrate light to the focal point of a telescope.
This type of mirror has a major advantage over conventional mirrors in that it is much cheaper to build (up to 100 times less expensive).
In 1982, Ermanno Franco Borra, a professor in the Physics Department at Laval University in Quebec, revived the historical proposal of creating liquid mirror telescopes and sought to demonstrate the feasibility of such a project.
Several liquid mirrors were subsequently developed at Laval University in the 1980’s.
In 1994, Paul Hickson of the University of British-Columbia completed the construction of the first liquid mirror telescope in collaboration with Borra.
The mirror measured 2.64 metres in diameter.
The following year, Hickson installed his telescope in the newly inaugurated University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory.
The efforts of Hickson and his collaborators culminated in 2004 when the 6-metre liquid mirror Large Zenith Telescope went into operation.
The Large Zenith Telescope is the third largest optical telescope in North America and the largest liquid mirror telescope in the world.
Despite its enormous size, the mirror components weigh only 3 tonnes.
At the present time, the observatory is involved in two large-scale projects.
The first is the construction of the ALPACA telescope (Advanced Liquid-mirror Probe for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Asteroids), which consists of a liquid mirror measuring 8 metres in diameter.
The array will simulate a telescope measuring 50 metres in diameter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Gemini North and South Observatory A pair of giant observatories – one in each hemisphere – to provide full sky coverage As the name would suggest, Gemini (which means "twins" in Latin) is the name given to two astronomical observatories.
The locations of these two observatories provide complete access to the sky from both hemispheres.
The idea to construct the two observatories arose in the mid-1980’s.
The venture really got going in 1990 when an agreement was signed between the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Observation time is distributed in these same proportions.
Gemini North saw first light in 1999, whereas Gemini South opened a year later in 2000.
The instruments on each telescope, however, are not necessarily the same (cameras, spectrometers, etc.). One of the main contributions made by Canada was to provide an adaptive optics system: a system that corrects image distortion due to turbulence in Earth’s atmosphere.
The construction of the dome, the support, the subterranean facilities and the system that controls the rotating part of each telescope was also Canada’s responsibility.
The system consists of 120 hydraulic jacks under the mirror that provide constant adjustments to restore it to a perfect shape.
The adjustments are typically on the order of one thousandth the width of a human hair.
The observatories were specifically designed to observe visible light, but also infrared light.
Clouds of gas and dust hide large sectors of space, like the regions where stars and planets are forming, or the cores of galaxies that contain quasars and black holes.
Infrared light is of great interest to astronomers because it is able to penetrate these clouds and reveal details that would otherwise be invisible.
The reflecting surface of the Gemini mirrors is made of a thin film of silver that reflects infrared rays better than aluminum, and the domes of the observatories are a metallic grey colour instead of the traditional white to keep the temperature of the telescopes constant.
Moving hatches allow the observing slits to open across the entire dome.
All these finishing touches make the Gemini telescopes expensive instruments to operate.
It currently costs about $50,000 for a single night of observation at one of the telescopes.
Astronomers, however, do not have to spend this amount themselves: user fees for a Gemini telescope are paid by the national agencies that finance the observatory.
Canadian participation in the Gemini telescopes is currently the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics   Video sequence   Jean-René Roy talks about the Gemini telescopes.
The satellite, which weighs 1,360 kilograms, was designed to last three years.
It was the result of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and France.
John Hutchings, an astronomer from the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s project scientist.
As the name would suggest, FUSE is an observatory with a mission to study distant sources of ultraviolet radiation, specifically in the range of 9 to 12 millionths of a centimetre.
This portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has been little studied up to this point, mainly because the ozone layer in Earth’s atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet rays that arrive from space.
Ultraviolet light is also particularly difficult to collect.
It becomes increasingly difficult for a mirror to reflect light at very short wavelengths because the waves tend to "slide" between the atoms of the reflecting surface.
X-rays, which are found immediately after ultraviolet rays in the electromagnetic spectrum, have such short wavelengths that they pass right through objects (of course this is also the very property that makes them so useful in medicine).
The FUSE Space Telescope consists of four mirrors specially designed for reflecting ultraviolet light.
Two mirrors are coated with silicon carbide, whereas the other two are coated with lithium fluoride over aluminum.
The FUSE Observatory is 10,000 times more sensitive than the Copernicus satellite (1972-1981), which was the last satellite to observe the sky in ultraviolet light.
The Canadian contribution consists of two fine guidance sensors that allow the space observatory to be aimed at its targets with a very high degree of precision.
This contribution guarantees Canada at least 5% of the available observation time.
The primary mission for FUSE is to analyse the amount of deuterium ("heavy" hydrogen) in the Universe in order to better understand the activity of stars since the Big Bang.
The amount of deuterium has been continually decreasing since the formation of the Universe as the nuclear processes in stars destroy it.
The observatory is also used for other research projects.
In 2000, for example, the telescope was used to discover an explosion involving thousands of stars has left a colossal halo of burning gas the shape of a football extending up to 5,000 to 10,000 light-years above and below the Milky Way.
The observatory is still functioning today, despite numerous setbacks that can be expected given its advanced age.
Video sequence   John Barrie Hutchings explains what FUSE is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory The only underground Canadian observatory The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory began operating in 1999 at a depth of 2,070 metres below the surface in the Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario.
The goal of the observatory is to detect and study neutrinos emitted by the Sun and other celestial objects.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Neutrinos are small elementary particles that are electrically neutral (that is, they have no electrical charge).
So little, in fact, that matter is virtually transparent to them, and therein lies the difficulty in detecting neutrinos.
Stars produce large amounts of neutrinos.
The Sun, for example, emits 200 trillion trillion trillion neutrinos each second.
Billions of neutrinos pass through the Sun, the Earth and your body every instant without being hindered.
In fact, during your entire lifetime, only one or two neutrinos will ever come into contact with one of the atoms in your body.
One of the major unresolved problems about our Sun is related to its production of neutrinos.
In the early 1980’s, it was realized that the number of solar neutrinos detected by various laboratories were less than predicted by theoretical calculations.
Two hypotheses were proposed: either that our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient, or that some of the neutrinos change their form during their voyage to the Earth (this phenomenon is known to affect other elementary particles), which would mean that the number of neutrinos reaching Earth is less than the amount originally emitted by the Sun.
In 1983, Canadian researchers proposed the construction of an underground neutrino detector in an Ontario nickel mine belonging to the company Inco.
The underground site would shield the detector from microwaves in the background cosmic radiation, which would normally impede the detection of solar neutrinos.
One year later, in 1984, an American researcher published a study that demonstrated the advantages of using heavy water (water in which the hydrogen atoms each have an extra neutron) as a neutrino detector.
Since Canada has an abundant reserve of heavy water, it was decided that the facility would operate as a heavy water detector.
The United States joined the project, follow by the United Kingdom in 1989.
Work began in 1990 and was completed in 1999.
The detector consists of 1,000 tonnes of ultra pure heavy water enclosed in a transparent plastic vessel measuring 12 metres across.
The vessel is itself enclosed in 7,000 tonnes of ultra pure normal water, lodged in an immense cavity measuring 22 metres wide and 34 metres high (the equivalent of a 10-storey building).
It is the largest underground opening ever excavated at two kilometres depth.
The acrylic vessel is surrounded by a 17-metre geodesic dome equipped with 9,600 detectors that sense the presence of neutrinos.
The frequency of neutrino detection is one per hour.
The results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory have demonstrated that neutrinos do indeed change their form during their trip from the Sun to the Earth, thus putting an end to the debate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Cosmic Background Imager An observatory for studying the oldest light ever emitted The Cosmic Background Imager was put into service in 2000 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
It was the result of collaboration between the United States, Canada and Chile.
The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the observatory.
The goal of the Imager is to make a map of the distribution of cosmic background radiation, microwave radiation that represents the aftermath of the Big Bang, the great explosion that gave birth to the Universe.
The Imager is thus studying the oldest light energy ever emitted.
Mapping the distribution of this ancient light – this ancient radiation – effectively allows researchers to "see" what the Universe looked like very shortly after its birth.
This information is extremely important because it helps them better understand the creation, organization and evolution of large structures in the cosmos, such as galaxy clusters.
The observatory’s telescope operates at wavelengths between 0.83 and 1.15 centimetres, which corresponds to the field of microwaves.
It consists of 13 parabolic antennas mounted on a platform measuring six metres in diameter that can be pointed anywhere in the sky.
Each antenna is 90 centimetres across and is lodged in a protective cylinder sealed with a Teflon cover that can transmit microwaves.
In 2002, the telescope detected a pattern in the distribution of background cosmic radiation that revealed structures much smaller than any observed to date.
Researchers also detected a second pattern that could provide new information about the movement of matter shortly after the Big Bang.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Odin Space Observatory An observatory that specializes in research about water and oxygen The Odin Space Observatory was launched into orbit in 2001.
It is a Swedish satellite that was developed in collaboration with Canada, Finland and France; Canada’s contribution is 20%.
It is the first international satellite in which Canada played a major role in design, construction and operation.
The observatory is named after the Norwegian and Germanic god Odin.
Its mission is twofold: the first objective focuses on aeronomy (the study of the atmosphere), and the second on astronomy.
The aeronomic goal is to study certain molecules that are found in Earth’s atmosphere – such as water, chlorine compounds and ozone – which can help us better understand the processes that cause thinning of the ozone layer.
The goal in terms of astronomy is to detect specific molecules in comets, planets, stars, interstellar clouds and galaxies.
The molecules of greatest interest are water and oxygen, because these cannot be studied from Earth’s surface: our atmosphere blocks any radiation emitted by these molecules in space.
All together the satellite weighs 250 kilograms.
Canada’s role in the project began in 1991 when informal discussions began with Sweden about a possible collaboration between the two countries.
An agreement was signed in 1994 that defined Canada’s role and the venture was launched.
Canada provided several instruments, including OSIRIS, which are used to study specific gases and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere for the aeronomic part of the mission.
The launch was initially planned for 1997, but after several delays and postponements, it finally took place in 2001.
The predicted life expectancy for the observatory was two years (that is, until 2003), but the satellite is still functioning today.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The MOST Space Telescope The first space telescope entirely of Canadian designed and construction The MOST Space Telescope (which stands for Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars) was launched into space in 2003.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
In 1997, the Canadian Space Agency agreed to finance the project and Jaymie Matthews was named Principal Investigator and Mission Scientist.
About the size and shape of a large suitcase, the satellite weighs only 54 kilograms and is equipped with an ultra high precision telescope that measures only 15 centimetres in diameter.
Despite its diminutive size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting the minuscule variations in a star’s luminosity caused by vibrations that shake its surface.
The telescope will complete one orbit around the Earth every 101 minutes by passing over each of Earth’s poles.
It will spend 60 days on each star studied.
Its predicted life expectancy is 5 to 10 years.
The first major discovery made by the telescope occurred as soon as it became operational.
The discovery was that Procyon, one of the most studied stars, shows no pulsations at all, which contradicts 20 years of ideas and observations, and forced astronomers to rethink their models for stars.
In 2005, MOST was responsible for another surprising discovery: it observed a giant planet that orbits so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with that of the planet.
Normally, it is the other way around: a planet synchronizes its orbit with that of its host star.
Video sequence  Jaymie Mark Matthews explains what MOST is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Atacama Large Millimeter Array What will be the largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be inaugurated in 2011 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
The array should be usable for scientific purposes before its completion, starting in 2007.
The creation of the array is the result of collaboration between Canada, the United States, Europe, Japan and Chile.
The National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the radio telescope.
The array consists of 62 parabolic antennas measuring 12 metres across and spread out over 14 kilometres in the desert.
They will operate together to simulate a single radio telescope with a diameter of 14 kilometres.
The antennas will operate at wavelengths between 0.00035 and 10 millimetres: that is, from submillimetre wavelengths to the beginning of the microwave range.
Canada will provide 64 ultra-sensitive receptors for the 3-millimetre wavelength range, as well as the image processing software for the radio telescope.
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be used to study the formation of planets, stars, distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and interstellar matter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James Webb Space Telescope The successor to the Hubble Space Telescope The James Webb Space Telescope will be launched into space at the beginning of the next decade.
However, it is too far to be repaired and maintained by astronauts, so its life span will only be 5 to 10 years.
The observatory bears the name of James Edwin Webb, director of NASA from 1961 to 1968.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and Europe.
John Hutchings, an astronomer with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s Project Scientist.
At 6.5 metres in diameter, the mirror of the telescope will have a surface seven times greater than that of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope (2.4-metre mirror).
The mirror will consist of 18 small hexagonal mirrors that will deploy and fit together once the telescope is in orbit.
The entire observatory will weigh 6,600 kilograms.
The telescope will operate at wavelengths between 28 thousandths to 6 millionths of a centimetre: that is, from the mid-range of the infrared to almost the beginning of visible red light (Hubble, in contrast, observes at ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths).
This range of wavelengths will make it possible to detect extrasolar planets, to conduct detailed studies into the formation of planets and stars, and to study the oldest galaxies lying at the edges of the Universe.
Canadian researchers are also part of the American and European teams in charge of designing other instruments for the space telescope.

The next generation
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers William Frederick King (1854-1916) He raised Canadian astronomy to international stature William Frederick King was born in 1854 at Stowmarket (Suffolk) in England.
His family immigrated to Canada in 1862 and settled down at Port Hope, Ontario.
In 1875, he obtained his bachelor’s degree with high distinctions from the University of Toronto, and he also earned the university’s gold medal in mathematics.
He spent his free time at the university performing complex mathematical calculations for personal amusement.
Later during his career, the University of Toronto awarded him an honorary doctoral degree for his work in astronomy in 1904.
King published many scientific articles on astronomy.
Without doubt, the most significant was his classic article The Geometry of Orbits in which he described a new method for calculating the orbits of binary stars.
The relative obscurity of his scientific career is more than compensated by his famous achievements as astronomer and administrator for the Canadian Government.
It was under his guidance that astronomy really took off in Canada, developing first at the national scale and then rising to international stature.
King entered the Canadian Government as a land surveyor and topographer in 1872 at the age of 18.
He worked on federal lands in western Canada where his knowledge of astronomy was an asset during mapping as it allowed him to determine the longitudes and latitudes of many locations.
He rose step by step through the government echelons until his nomination as Chief Inspector of Surveys for the Department of the Interior in 1886.
In 1887, King began to pressure the government into creating a federal astronomical observatory.
In 1890, he founded the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior with the help of Edward Gaston Daniel Deville and Otto Julius Klotz.
He became its first director that same year and built a small wooden observatory on Cliff Street.
King was nominated seven times as Commissioner of the International Boundary Commission between 1892 and 1908, and he thus helped establish the Canadian-American border.
The world longitude network across the Pacific Ocean was also completed under his direction.
In 1908, he was named Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George for his work.
In 1900, he became founding president of the Ottawa Centre for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, a position he maintained until his death in 1916.
His efforts to create a large and permanent astronomical observatory bore fruit in 1905 with the inauguration of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
The observatory was equipped with 38-centimetre astronomical telescope and King became its first director.
In 1909, he succeeded where many before him had tried and failed: he founded the Geodetic Survey Division of Canada and became its first director.
Using a variety of methods, including astronomical measurements, the Division managed to precisely determine the position and elevation of many reference points throughout the country, which greatly assisted in the making of geographic maps.
In 1910, only five years after the creation of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, King was in charge of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory near Victoria, British Columbia, but died before its inauguration.
In 1911, King was elected President of the Royal Society of Canada, the highest scientific distinction in Canada at the time.
He passed away in Ottawa in 1916 at 62 years old.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Stanley Plaskett (1865-1941) He laid the basic foundation for astrophysical research in Canada John Stanley Plaskett was born in 1865 on a farm in Hickson, Ontario.
He began working at the Edison Company (which later become General Electric) in 1886 where he gained experience in mechanics and electricity.
Determined to obtain a university education, he enrolled in the bachelor’s program in 1895 and earned his diploma four years later in 1899 at the age of 33.
Plaskett received four honorary doctoral degrees from Canadian and American universities during his career.
After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Plaskett taught as a lecturer in the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1903, William Frederick King hired him as part of the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior to help design and construct instruments for the new Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
Plaskett became an invaluable addition to the team thanks to his experience in electricity, mechanics and photography.
Plaskett made his first real foray into astronomy in 1905 at the age of 39.
William Frederick King assigned him the responsibility of astrophysical work at the Dominion Observatory.
During his first research project, he was responsible for studying a total eclipse of the Sun that would be visible from Labrador.
In 1907, after working for two years on a new spectroscope of his own design, Plaskett attached it to the telescope of the Dominion Observatory.
He mainly used it to measure the radial velocities of stars (the speed at which the star is moving away or toward the observer), and managed to collect several thousand spectrograms over the following years.
It quickly became evident, however, that the observatory’s 38-centimetre telescope was not efficient enough for the purpose.
In 1910, Plaskett proposed to William Frederick King that a new giant telescope be constructed.
King was enthusiastic about the idea and the two astronomers began pressuring the Canadian Government to make it a reality.
In 1913, Parliament freed up funds and Plaskett worked for the next five years on the design of a 1.83-metre telescope – the biggest in the world – for the new Dominion Astrophysical Observatory to be built in Victoria, British Columbia.
The new observatory was inaugurated in 1918.
Plaskett continued his work on the radial velocities of stars.
In 1922, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star; it is known today as "Plaskett’s Star".
Between 1928 and 1935, Plaskett published a series of articles with Joseph Algernon Pearce on the radial velocities of stars and confirmed that our galaxy, the Milky Way, rotates.
In fact, he was the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 of the distance from the centre of our galaxy, and that our solar system takes approximately 220 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
He took his retirement in 1935 and died in 1941 in Esquimalt, British Columbia at the age of 75.
In 1988, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Canadian Astronomical Society created the Plaskett Medal, awarded each year to the author of the best doctoral thesis in astronomy or astrophysics at a Canadian university.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Clarence Augustus Chant (1865-1956) The Father  of Canadian astronomy Clarence Augustus Chant was born in 1865 at Hagerman’s Corners, Ontario.
He finished high school in 1884 and taught for three years at a school.
He enrolled at the University of Toronto in 1887 and received his bachelor’s degree in 1890.
He secured a job with the Department of Finance in Ottawa, but only stayed for two years.
Chant was determined to obtain a university post, and in 1892, he was hired as a lecturer for the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1898, he spent the summer in Germany to study the theory of light, and in 1900 he received his Master’s degree while continuing his role as lecturer.
He left Toronto for Harvard University in the United States and returned the following year, doctoral degree in hand.
His interest for astronomy began in 1892 when he was hired by the physics department of the University of Toronto.
He joined the Physics and Astronomy Society of Toronto, which changed its name to the Astronomical Society of Toronto in 1900, and again to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1902.
Chant acted as President from 1904 to 1907.
In 1904, Chant suggested that the University of Toronto increase the number of astronomy courses offered by the physics department.
His proposal was well received and six courses were added to the program in 1905.
Until a second professor was hired in 1926, Chant was the sole Canadian professor to train professional astronomers.
It was his role of having taught virtually all the original Canadian astronomers that earned Chant his reputation as the "Father  of Canadian astronomy".
No less than five of his former students went on to become directors of astronomical observatories.
In 1906, the lack of a large telescope in the Toronto region prompted Chant to campaign for an astronomical observatory that would be the property of the University of Toronto or the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Meanwhile, in the absence of a suitable telescope, he focused his research on total solar eclipses.
The astronomy department of the University of Toronto was officially established in 1920 and Chant became its first chairman.
The physics department consequently ceased to offer astronomy courses.
In 1921, Chant met David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, and got him interested in the idea of building a large telescope observatory for the Toronto region.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924 and seemingly with him any chance of realizing Chant’s goal.
Chant led an expedition to Australia in 1922 to observe a total eclipse of the sun and to verify Einstein’s theory of relativity concerning the deflection of light by a body as massive as a star.
It proved to be one of the first verifications of Einstein’s theory.
In 1928, Chant published Our Wonderful Universe with enormous success, and the book was translated into five languages.
In 1935, the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto was inaugurated on the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed the second largest telescope in the world, measuring 1.88 metres across.
Chant died in 1956 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, at the age of 91.
He published many scientific books and articles, and received numerous awards.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Carlyle Smith Beals (1899-1979) He expanded and developed astrophysics and geophysics in Canada Carlyle Smith Beals was born in 1899 at Canso, Nova Scotia.
He enrolled instead at the University of Toronto and obtained his Master’s degree in 1923.
Beals then returned to the University of Acadia where he was hired as assistant professor in physics.
He only stayed for one year before accepting a job in 1927 at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He stayed at the observatory considerably longer: 20 years, in fact.
Shortly after his arrival, he began to perfect or invent new instruments for the observatory’s telescope.
He established a reliable temperature scale for very hot stars and was the first to demonstrate that their emission spectra are proof that they are surrounded by large gaseous envelopes.
He wrote a thesis on the subject and received a second doctoral degree from the University of London in 1934.
Beals also discovered that the wide emission lines from Wolf-Rayet and P Cygni-type stars are the result of gaseous material ejecting from their surfaces.
He was also the first to recognize that the gas in interstellar space is not uniformly distributed and that it is locally concentrated into clouds that move at high speeds.
In 1940, he became Adjoint Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory of Victoria.
Beals attracted many young researchers to Ottawa, improved the institution’s seismological, gravimetric, magnetic and solar facilities, modernized its official time distribution service, installed new telescopes in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, installed cameras to observe meteors in Alberta, and established the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1956, he began publishing geophysical studies on terrestrial and lunar impact craters, and in so doing demonstrated that meteorite bombardment played a major role in the formation of the planets, including Earth.
Beals retired in 1964 and died in 1979 in Ottawa at the age of 80.
He received many awards for his work in astronomy, geophysics and administration, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 3314 and a lunar crater were named in his honour.
In 1981, the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Carlyle S. Beals Award, given every two years to a Canadian astronomer, or an astronomer working in Canada, in recognition of their outstanding achievement in research.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gerhard Herzberg (1904-1999) He helped make the National Research Council of Canada a world-renowned centre of excellence Gerhard Herzberg was born in 1904 at Hamburg, Germany.
During the early 1920’s, he decided to follow a career in astronomy but was quickly dissuaded by the scarcity of jobs in the field.
He enrolled at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology in 1924 where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1927 and a doctoral degree in physical engineering in 1928.
Specializing in atomic and molecular physics, he completed his first postdoctoral position at the University of Göttingen in 1928 and a second postdoctoral assignment at the University of Bristol in 1929.
In 1930, he was hired as a lecturer and assistant to the head of the physics department at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology.
He built a large spectroscopic laboratory and supervised the research of several students and guest researchers.
The German authorities would only allow him to leave with about $2.50, and he sought refuge in Canada where he was offered a guest professorship at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.
Three months later, he became professor in the physics department, a position he occupied for the next six years.
His work focused mainly on molecular spectroscopy; that is, on the analysis of molecular structure.
More specifically, Herzberg concentrated on the detection and the nature of free radicals.
Free radicals are intermediary molecules in chemical reactions that only exist for several millionths of a second in the laboratory, but much longer in space.
One of his first accomplishments at Saskatoon was to identify the CH+ molecule in interstellar clouds (clouds of gas found between stars).
At the time, only two other molecules had been identified in such an environment.
In addition to the numerous scientific articles that he wrote, he also published three books (1936, 1939 and 1945) that quickly became classics in atomic and molecular spectroscopy.
In 1945, the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago offered Herzberg a position as professor of spectroscopy at their extensive state-of-the-art facilities.
He studied comets and planetary atmospheres by perfecting methods that would go on to become standard techniques used around the world.
In 1948, he returned to Canada and was named Principal Research Officer at the National Research Council, and Director of the Division of Physics shortly afterwards.
He soon began to assemble a group of talented spectroscopists with specialities in various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (microwaves, infrared, visible light and ultraviolet light), and created research teams in the fields of theoretical and solid state physics.
Herzberg continued to add to his major scientific discoveries: he was the first to detect the hydrogen molecule in planetary atmospheres, the first to uncover the presence of water in comets, and the first to identify dozens of free radicals (including methylene CH2 and methyl CH3) in the laboratory and interstellar clouds.
He also established the National Research Council of Canada as a world leader in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1966, 1971 and 1979, he published three other books that each became a classic in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1969, the National Research Council of Canada created the post of Distinguished Research Scientist for him, which he occupied until his retirement.
In 1974, the Council combined its astronomy and spectroscopy units and created the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, where he worked until his retirement in 1995.
Herzberg died in Ottawa in 1999 at 94 years old.
He had received numerous distinctions, including the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Asteroid 3316 was named in his honour.
In 2004, the National Research Council of Canada created its highest honour, the Herzberg Medal, to bestow upon a scientist whose research contributions are characterized by both excellence and influence.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Helen Sawyer Hogg (1905-1993) A world expert in galaxy clusters and variable stars, she inspired many women to enter science and helped popularize astronomy in Canada Helen Sawyer was born in 1905 at Lowell, Massachusetts.
In 1922, she enrolled at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, and obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1926.
She then received her master’s degree in 1928 and her doctoral degree in 1931, both from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Her research topic was the study of variable starts in globular clusters, and she would work on this type of star for the rest of her life.
In 1930, she married Frank Hogg, a young Canadian and fellow astronomy student.
In 1931, they moved to Canada where Frank accepted a post at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
Unfortunately, the depression had hit and Helen was unable to find work.
She nonetheless obtained permission to use the observatory’s telescope and was able to pursue her study of globular masses on a volunteer basis.
In 1935, Helen and Frank relocated to Ontario where Frank took a professorship with the astronomy department at the University of Toronto.
Helen pursued her observations of globular clusters at the David Dunlap Observatory, and she was hired as a research officer in the astronomy department in 1936.
Two years later, in 1941, she started teaching at the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
In 1946, Helen’s husband Frank became Director of the David Dunlap Observatory, a position he would occupy until his death in 1951.
In 1957, Hogg became adjunct full professor in the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
She continued her work on variable stars, which numbered more than 2,000 by the end of her career.
The parameters she measured during her research provided a basis for estimating the age of our galaxy and for improving our understanding of its evolution.
In 1970, Hogg hosted her own television show on astronomy.
In 1971, she founded the Astronomical Society of Canada and became its first president.
She retired in 1976, was named Professor Emeritus, and wrote a popular guide to astronomy titled The Stars Belong to Everyone.
Helen Sawyer Hogg died in Toronto at the age of 92.
She had received numerous distinctions for her work in astronomy and for her efforts to popularize the science, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 2917 was named in her honour.
In 1985, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Helen Sawyer Hogg Public Lecture.
The lecture, given each year by an invited speaker during the annual meeting of the two societies, commemorates her contributions to public appreciation of the universe.
The Canadian National Museum of Science and Technology's observatory in Ottawa is named for her.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Andrew McKellar (1910-1960) Known around the world as one of Canada’s best astronomers, he was the first to measure the temperature of the Universe Andrew McKellar was born in 1910 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
In 1930, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and then enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where he obtained his master’s degree in 1932 and his doctoral degree in 1933.
He specialized in molecular spectroscopy; that is, in the detection and analysis of molecular structure.
In 1933, he became a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
It was there that he made his first forays into astronomy by studying the Sun.
In 1935, he accepted a position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He began measuring the orbits of binary stars and pursued his own research into molecular spectroscopy.
World War II erupted in 1939 and McKellar became a research officer for the Royal Canadian Navy.
He attained the rank of lieutenant commander, all the while pursuing his astronomy work and publishing several significant scientific articles.
In 1940, he began using spectroscopy to determine the composition of comets and demonstrated that solar rays modify their spectra.
Also in 1940, he was the first to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectrum of the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
In 1978, with McKellar having passed away almost twenty years earlier, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Penzias and Wilson for their part in the discovery that launched the Big Bang hypothesis to the forefront of cosmological theories.
When World War II ended in 1945, McKellar reclaimed his position as researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria and remained there until his death in 1960.
In 1948, he was the first to provide proof of the existence of the carbon-nitrogen cycle ("CN cycle") within cold carbon stars.
The CN cycle, which had been predicted 10 years earlier, is a chain of thermonuclear reactions in which carbon and nitrogen combine to release enormous amounts of energy.
According to the theory, it is this energy that sustains cold carbon stars.
During the 1950’s, McKellar became increasingly interested in giant cold stars (those with surface temperatures as low as 2,000° C) and broadened our knowledge about their size and chemical composition.
Among other contributions, he demonstrated that large turbulent movements could agitate their atmospheres.
Succumbing to an incurable disease, he died in 1960 in Victoria, British Columbia, at the young age of 50.
He had completed a full day of work at the observatory just four days before he passed away.
McKellar received many awards for his work in astronomy, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
In 1962, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria named their 1.2-metre telescope in his honour.
The telescope is used to measure the speed of stars and to determine their chemical compositions.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Arthur Edwin Covington (1913-2001) As Canada’s first radio astronomer, he collected data on solar activity every day for more than thirty years; his work constitutes the world’s best database in the field Arthur Edwin Covington was born in 1913 in Regina, Saskatchewan.
In 1938, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and obtained his master’s degree from the same institution in 1940.
That same year, he enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where, two years later in 1942, he received his doctoral degree in nuclear physics.
At that point, he moved to Ottawa, Ontario, and participated in the war effort by helping develop new radar systems at the National Research Council of Canada.
After the war, Covington proposed a research project that would convert surplus radar equipment into instruments that could study cosmic radiation.
His proposal was accepted in 1946 and he began constructing the first Canadian radio telescope.
Once the equipment had been calibrated, he decided to measure the radiation emanating from the Sun, or more specifically, it’s "radio flux": the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths.
He began collecting data in July of 1946 and quickly realized that the flux changed from day to day.
Unable to determine whether these daily variations were related to problems with the instruments or to the presence of dark spots ("sunspots") found on the Sun’s surface, he decided to use a partial solar eclipse on November 23, 1946, to his advantage: he would monitor any variations in the radio flux as sunspots became covered by the Moon.
Much to his surprise, he determined that the dimmer regions of the Sun – those marked by sunspots – emit much stronger radiation than the more luminous unmarked areas.
He thus provided the first direct evidence that sunspots are associated with radiation "hot spots".
Encouraged by this discovery, Covington began collecting daily data on the Sun’s radio flux in 1947, and succeeded in demonstrating that the number of sunspots is related to the Sun’s radiation flux.
He collected data on a continuous basis from that point forward and his measurements were used around the world.
In 1951, he constructed a device that would detect the radiation emitted by specific regions on the Sun’s surface.
He thus managed to measure the brilliance of the Sun’s corona (the uppermost level of the Sun’s atmosphere) and the temperature of the regions above sunspots (about 1,500,000 °C).
His work would greatly contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that create sunspots.
Covington succeeded in demonstrating that the intensity of solar radiation is related to the magnetic activity of the Sun, which has crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems, power lines, climate predictions, agriculture, fishing, space exploration, manmade satellites, geophysics, etc.
In 1959, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was established in Ontario and Covington became its director.
He took his retirement in 1978 and died in 2001 in Kingston, Ontario, at 88 years old.
One of the buildings at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Penticton was named in his honour in 2003.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Anne Barbara Underhill (1920-2003) A pioneer in the field of hot blue stars, she perfected sophisticated calculation techniques to better understand their atmospheres Anne Barbara Underhill was born in 1920 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
She obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1942 and her master’s degree in 1944 from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1948, Underhill completed postdoctoral work at the Copenhagen Observatory in Denmark, and then joined the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, where she stayed until 1962.
Underhill specialized in the study of "early-type stars" or "OB stars"; that is, very hot blue stars.
Newly discovered and poorly understood at the time, these stars were surrounded by very thick atmospheres.
Underhill collected a lot of data on OB stars at Victoria but quickly realized that no existing mathematical model could interpret her data.
Not one to give up, Underhill took it upon herself to develop and perfect the mathematical equations required to model the atmospheres of OB stars.
She began in the 1950’s, an era in which the only available computers were mechanical devices that had to be manually operated; it was an arduous task due to the enormous amount of time required to complete each calculation.
In 1962, Underhill became a professor of stellar astrophysics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands where she pursued her work on OB stars.
In 1966, she wrote The Early Type Stars, a book that quickly became a standard reference for OB stars.
In 1970, Underhill became the director of the new optical astronomy laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Maryland.
She contributed to the development of the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite until 1977, at which point she returned to her work on OB stars.
It was in the 1970’s that Underhill became convinced that Wolf-Rayet type stars are young, not old (an idea that we now know to be incorrect), and she retained this conviction for the rest of her life.
Wolf-Rayet stars release colossal quantities of matter into space.
She retired in 1985 and returned to Canada as Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Victoria.
She died in Vancouver at the age of 83.
She received numerous awards for her work in astronomy and was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Sidney van den Bergh (1929- ) A world expert in galaxy classification and the measurement of cosmic distances, he made several estimates of the size and age of the Universe Sidney van den Berg was born in 1929 in Wassenaar, Netherlands.
He spent one year at the University of Leiden and then went to Princeton University in the United States on a scholarship.
He received his bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1950, and his master’s from Ohio State University in 1952.
He finished his studies in 1956 with a doctoral degree from the University of Göttingen in Germany.
He was hired as a professor at Ohio State University the same year he graduated, and he stayed there until 1958 when he accepted a professorship at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto in Ontario.
He became involved in expanding the observatory’s facilities, perfecting computerized calculation techniques, and developing the field of polychrome photometry.
Van den Bergh’s main specialty was the study of meteors, but his interests quickly diversified and by 1960 he had already published numerous articles on globular clusters, interstellar clouds, galaxies and supernovae.
Four years later, he became President and Chairman of the Board of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation.
He retired in 1986, but retained a researcher position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria.
Today, van den Bergh focuses his research on the classification and the evolution of galaxies using images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
He retains an interest in a number of diverse subjects: among others, he published an article in 1992 that refuted the idea of an astronomical significance for the Nazca lines of Peru, and one in 1994 demonstrating that it is unlikely supernova explosions caused mass extinctions on Earth.
Van den Bergh has published more than 500 scientific articles.
He received numerous awards for his work and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 bears his name in his honour.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Hubert Reeves (1932- ) A specialist in the origin of light elements and a highly talented popularizer of astronomy, he is often called "the poet of the stars" Hubert Reeves was born in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in 1953, his master’s from McGill University in Montreal in 1955, and his doctoral degree from Cornell University in New York in 1960.
In 1965, he became the Director of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ("National Science Research Centre") in Paris and a scientific consultant for the Commissariat à l’énergie atomique ("Nuclear Energy Commission") in Saclay, France.
A specialist in astrophysics, Reeves studies the thermonuclear reactions that occur in stars; that is, the reactions that create the chemical elements that make up matter.
Since 1962, his work has focused on nuclear reactions involving carbon and oxygen.
He also focuses part of his research on neutrinos, a type of subatomic particle that we still know very little about.
In 1967, he became increasingly interested in the origin of the light elements lithium, beryllium and boron.
The very high temperatures that occur inside stars would destroy these three elements, so they must form elsewhere, namely out in space.
In 1968, he published Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, and in 1972 he wrote Nuclear Reactions in Stellar Surfaces and their Relations with Stellar Evolution.
These were the only two publications, among his many books, that were written for specialists in the field.
In 1971, Reeves helped demonstrate, along with other colleagues, that a process known as "spallation" creates lithium, beryllium and boron.
During this process, the atomic nuclei of relatively heavy elements, like oxygen, "break" under the impact of cosmic rays (particles that travel at high speed through space).
Some of the "pieces" created by these collisions are lithium, beryllium or boron atoms.
In 1972, Reeves collaborated with Johannes Geiss to explain the origin of two other light elements: deuterium and helium-3.
The test for their hypothesis was made possible by experiments conducted during the Apollo moon missions, and the results also allowed them to estimate the density of normal matter in the Universe.
In 1977, Reeves published Soleil ("Sun"), his first popular science book.
Four years later, in 1981, he wrote another, Patience dans l’azur ("Patience in the Sky"), about the different steps in the formation of the Universe that gained immediate international acclaim.
Another 15 or so popular astronomy books were published in the years to follow, some with co-authors.
The beginning of the 1980’s marked a time of increasing popularity for Reeves as he gave many public lectures and appeared on television shows and in films, speaking not just on the topic of astronomy, but also the environment.
Reeves received many awards and distinctions for his work in astronomy and public communications.
In 2001, he and Johannes Geiss received the Einstein prize for their work on the density of the Universe.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers René Racine (1939- ) As an inventor of exceptional astronomical instruments, he played a key role in the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory René Racine was born in 1939 in Quebec City.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City in 1963, and went on to the University of Toronto where he received his master’s degree in 1965 and his doctoral degree in 1967.
He then obtained a research scholarship at the Carnegie Institute and spent the next two years (1967-1969) at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories near Pasadena, California.
Racine specializes in the study of globular clusters.
Globular clusters are collections of stars that form a spherical shape containing anywhere from 10,000 to millions of stars.
Racine studies them using photometry, a technique that measures the intensity of light emitted from an object, which can be used to extract information about its size, temperature, etc.
In 1969, he became a professor in the astronomy and astrophysics department of the University of Toronto.
Upon his arrival, Racine teamed up with colleagues Sidney van den Bergh and Robert F. Garrison to propose that the new observatory for the university be built at Las Campanas in Chile.
The 60-centimetre telescope saw first light in 1971, and Racine equipped it with a new photometer of his own design.
In 1976, he became astronomy professor for the physics department at the University of Montreal.
Racine played a key role in the creation of the new Mont-Mégantic Observatory and was its director from 1976 to 1980.
In 1980, he was named Executive Director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation (CFWT).
He worked on improving the image quality of the telescope and succeeded in producing the highest resolution images in the world, all the while pursuing his work in astronomical research.
In 1984, he left his post as Director of the CFWT and returned as Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
In 1997, he retired from his positions as Adjunct Full Professor and Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, and became Professor Emeritus at the University of Montreal.
Racine was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1989 and the Order of Canada in 1999.
In 2005, he was made an Officer of the Ordre national du Québec (National Order of Quebec).
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Barrie Hutchings (1941- ) He was the first to discover a black hole outside our galaxy John Barrie Hutchings was born in 1941 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1962, his bachelor’s with Honours in 1963, and his master’s in 1964 from the Rand University of South Africa.
He then obtained his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England in 1967.
From 1967 to 1969, he took a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, and he remains there as a researcher to this day.
Hutchings specializes in the atmospheres of OB stars (very hot blue stars).
In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, generate hot stellar winds.
In 1983, after ten years of research on binary stars, he made a major discovery:
Hutchings, along with coworkers Anne Cowley and David Crampton, identified the first black hole located outside our galaxy.
Not even one year later, in 1984, he made a second remarkable discovery by proving, along with David Crampton and Bruce Campbell, that quasars are the centres of active galaxies.
Active galaxies are those with centres marked by enormous energy outputs.
Over the years, the study of quasars became one of Hutchings specialties.
In 1987, he became part of the FUSE satellite science team as Canada’s Project Scientist (FUSE stands for "Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer").
In 1994, Hutchings became Chairman of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
In 1997, thanks to a newly installed spectrograph on the HST, he and some of his collaborators were the first to observe plumes of matter emitted from the centres of active galaxies.
In 1998, he was named Canadian Principal Investigator for the proposed CUVIT space mission (Canadian UV Imaging Telescope).
In 2000, Hutchings became Canada’s Principal Investigator for ASTROSAT, a satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organization to study galactic objects and distant extra-galactic objects.
Hutchings has published more than 400 scientific articles to date.
He received numerous distinctions for his work, including his election as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Charles Thomas Bolton (1943- ) He was the first to discover a black hole Charles Thomas Bolton was born in 1943 at Camp Forrest, a World War II military base in Tennessee, United States.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1966 from the University of Illinois and his master’s (1968) and doctoral degrees (1970) from the University of Michigan.
From 1970 to 1972, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto astronomy department.
He also taught at the David Dunlap Observatory from 1970 to 1972, at Scarborough College from 1971 to 1972, and at Erindale College from 1972 to 1973.
He then became a professor in the astronomy department at the University of Toronto in 1973, and has remained there ever since.
In 1970, Bolton was the first to develop a computer model for stellar atmospheres that was able to generate large regions of the modeled spectrum with enough precision to allow comparison with the spectra from real stars.
In 1972, Bolton made a discovery in astronomy that was so important it guaranteed him a place in the history books: he was the first astronomer to present irrefutable evidence of the existence of a black hole.
The black hole in question was Cygnus X-1, which lies at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
Bolton detected its presence by observing star HDE 226868 wobble as if it was orbiting around an invisible but massive companion.
His calculations demonstrated that the companion could be nothing less than a black hole.
A black hole is a celestial body that is so massive and dense that nothing can escape its gravitational pull (its attractive force), not even light.
The name arises from the fact that it cannot emit light and thus appears black, and it traps all that falls into it, like a hole in space.
In 1978, Bolton demonstrated that the nitrogen anomalies observed in the spectra of OBN stars are due to the transfer of material to a nearby neighbouring star.
OB stars are very hot blue stars with thick atmospheres.
OBN stars are a subclass of OB stars that are characterized by nitrogen anomalies in their spectra.
In 1981, he suggested that the ejections of material from Be-type stars – a subclass of B stars – are caused by non-radial pulsations (vibrations that shake Be stars in an irregular manner).
Bolton established a Canadian first in the 1990’s when he wrote a bylaw to regulate light pollution that was adopted by the town of Richmond Hill, Ontario, in 1994.
Bolton has received many awards for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jean-René Roy (1943- ) Astrophysicist and current Director of the Gemini Astronomical Observatory, which owns two of the biggest telescopes in the world Jean-René Roy was born in 1943 in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in Quebec in 1969 before moving to the University of Western Ontario in London where he obtained his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1971 and 1973.
In 1977, he organized a workshop on the causes of the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction that marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs.
That same year, Roy became an astronomy professor in the physics department at Laval University in Quebec City and later contributed to the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, which was inaugurated in 1978.
In 1982, Roy published his first book, L’astronomie et son histoire ("Astronomy and its History").
That same year, he and his colleagues, Yvon Georgelin and Jacques Boulesteix, designed a new Fabry-Perot interferometer for the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
Other instruments were to follow.
In 1997, he became a member of the board of directors for the Gemini Project, a proposal to construct the two largest telescopes in the world.
One of the telescopes would be located in the northern hemisphere (Hawaii) and the other in the southern hemisphere (Chile).
In 2000, he left Laval University to become the scientific director for the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii.
His current research interests are spiral galaxies, the processes of massive star formation, and the chemical enrichment in galaxies.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Peter Gordon Martin (1947- ) A specialist in the study of interstellar matter, he was involved in numerous international research projects Peter Gordon Martin was born in 1947 at Owen Sound  in Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto in 1968 and his master’s degree in 1969.
Three years later, in 1972, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England, and then returned to the University of Toronto to take a post as professor.
He strives to understand its origin and its relationship to stars.
To do this, he analyzes and interprets data gathered by telescopes on Earth and in space, and integrates these data into theoretical computer simulations.
During the first 15 years of his career, Martin concentrated mainly on interstellar dust.
Subjected to the magnetic fields produced by various celestial objects, interstellar dust tends to align itself in space like a magnet.
Any light passing through these particles likewise become aligned (the light becomes "polarized"), and by studying this light, it becomes possible to extract information about the composition and shape of the interstellar grains.
In 1984, Martin became the first person from the astronomy department at the University of Toronto to become a member of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Not long after, in 1987, he became interested in the collisions affecting hydrogen molecules of interstellar gas clouds where stars are born.
His contributions in this field have repercussions for our understanding of how the first stars of the Universe came to be.
Martin used the Orion nebula as a case study in 1991 to examine the conditions within nebulas and other regions where interstellar matter is concentrated.
The results of these studies have improved our understanding of the evolution of galaxies in the Universe.
In 1995, he became a permanent member of the science committee that manages the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, a project that aims to map a large portion (60 degrees) of our galaxial plane at several different wavelengths using a common resolution.
Martin uses the collected data to study the formation of massive stars and the evolution of interstellar dust, as well as its influence on the ecology of our galaxy.
In 1999, Martin was named Director of the University of Toronto’s David Dunlap Observatory.
He is currently involved in a number of international research projects, including the James Webb Space Telescope (the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope), the Herschel Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Planck space mission.
Martin received the Carlyle S. Beals Award in 1994 from the Astronomical Society of Canada in recognition of his research contributions.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gilles Fontaine (1948- ) An asteroseismologist and world specialist in white dwarf stars Gilles Fontaine was born in 1948 at Lévis, near Quebec City.
In 1969, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and his doctoral degree in 1974 from the University of Rochester in the state of New York.
He then took a postdoctoral position at the University of Western Ontario in London, and in 1977 he became a professor at the University of Montreal.
Fontaine has specialized in the study of white dwarf stars since he first started his doctoral studies.
A white dwarf forms when a star depletes its nuclear fuel.
Asteroseismologists – scientist who study the vibrations of stars – can measure these changes in intensity with an instrument known as a photometer.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
It is analogous to seismology, in which geophysicists study earthquakes as a means to probe the internal structure of the Earth.
In 1982, only one year after forming, the team used mathematical models to predict the existence of a new type of pulsating star: the DB-type white dwarf.
That same year, their prediction was confirmed by telescopic observations of a DB white dwarf.
It was a first in astrophysics because, up to that point, new star types were discovered before being theoretically predicted.
In 1987, Fontaine and his collaborators had the idea to determine the age of the Universe using white dwarfs.
Since white dwarfs are very old stars nearing the end of their life, to determine their age would effectively estimate the age of the galaxy and – in the bigger picture – that of the Universe.
In order to accomplish this goal, Fontaine designed numerical simulation models that weighted several parameters for a given star – such as mass, temperature and luminosity – and calculated the time that it would take for the white dwarf to cool.
In 1990, Fontaine published the first results within the framework of the Montréal-Cambridge-Tololo Project, which he helped develop.
The main goal of the project was the systematic exploration of white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere.
In 1996, Fontaine and his team once again theoretically predicted the existence of a new type of star, a B-type white subdwarf, and astronomers once again confirmed its existence, this time at the South African Astronomical Observatory in 1997.
In the years since, Fontaine and his collaborators have continued to predict other types of stars.
Fontaine received numerous distinctions for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 is named in his honour.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Richard Bond (1950- ) World expert in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, he made Canada a leader in cosmology John Richard Bond was born in 1950 in Toronto.
In 1973, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto and enrolled at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974.
He became a member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and helped establish the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Bond specializes in the study of the structure of the Universe.
During the 1980’s, very few researchers believed that it would be possible to detect variations in the cosmic background radiation due to its incredibly old age of 14 billion years.
However, in 1991, the COBE satellite (COsmic Background Explorer) did indeed reveal slight variations.
Encouraged by these results, Bond continued to develop many sophisticated mathematical tools during the 1990’s in order to study these variations.
He published many significant articles that established new rigorous standards in various disciplines or created entirely new research domains.
Bond’s studies were so numerous between 1981 and 1997 that he was the most cited Canadian astronomer in specialized journals during that time (more than 3,000 citations).
In 1996, he was named Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
In 1998, the first Boomerang mission was launched above the Antarctic.
It consisted of a balloon that carried a 1.20-metre telescope (named Boomerang) to an altitude of 35 kilometres to avoid the terrestrial atmosphere that would interfere with its instruments.
In 2000, Bond and several colleagues used the Boomerang results to demonstrate that the Universe has a planar geometry and to confirm that it is expanding.
In 2001, Bond became director of research programs at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
Today, he tries to understand the cause of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is to understand the very nature of dark energy that Einstein first introduced in his theories as "the cosmological constant".
It is proposed that dark energy is a repulsive force that counterbalances and may exceed the braking force of gravity; it is the force that attempts to push the expansion of the Universe to infinity.
According to Bond, it is possible that some small trace – some evidence – of the existence of dark energy could be found in the cosmic background radiation.
Bond received (and continues to receive) numerous national and international awards for his work, including being elected as a member to the Royal Society of Canada.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Scott Duncan Tremaine (1950- ) As a world expert in cosmic dynamics, he made several predictions that were subsequently confirmed by observation Scott Duncan Tremaine was born in 1950 in Toronto.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from McMaster’s University in 1971, and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1973 and 1975 respectively from the University of Princeton in the United States.
Upon obtaining his doctoral degree, he was hired as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He stayed for two years and then moved to England in 1977 to become a research agent in the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge.
One year later, he returned to the United States to be a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in New Jersey.
Tremaine is an expert in cosmic dynamics; that is, the study of the effects of forces that move celestial objects.
In simple terms, he is trying to determine the changes in speeds and directions that affect various bodies.
He has applied this type of study to planetary rings, comets, planets, black holes, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
In 1979, he and Peter Goldreich predicted that the rings of Uranus (discovered in 1977) are kept in place by small moons that have not yet been detected.
The proposal met with scepticism from many astronomers, until the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the planet in 1986 and confirmed the prediction.
It was quite a triumph.
Thanks to his energy, the institute eventually carved itself an enviable position in the international scene.
In 1987, Tremaine wrote the book Galactic Dynamics with James Binney, which quickly became a reference work in the field.
In 1988, he and other collaborators demonstrated that comets with short periods (comets that visit us every 200 years or less) originate in the Kuiper belt and not the Oort cloud.
This revelation proved to be another high point in his career.
In 1991, Tremaine and Michel Fich determined the mass of our galaxy, the Milky Way, by using information about satellite galaxies (those that orbit our own).
In 1996, he left his position as Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics to head the Cosmology and Gravity Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Studies.
One year later, in 1997, he left the University of Toronto to become a professor at Princeton University in the United States where he remains today.
Tremaine has received many awards, including being elected as member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jaymie Mark Matthews (1958- ) Asteroseismologist, outstanding popularizer of astronomy, and mission scientist for MOST: the first Canadian space telescope Jaymie Mark Matthews was born in 1958 in Chatham, Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in 1979 from the University of Toronto and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1982 and 1987 from the University of Western Ontario in London.
In 1988, he undertook postdoctoral research at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1991, he was hired as a research agent at the University of Montreal.
He then became a professor at the University of British Columbia.
Matthews is an asteroseismologist; that is, he specializes in the study of the vibrations (pulsations) that shake stars.
All stars, like the Sun, vibrate at some time during their lifespan.
The study of such vibrations holds great interest for researchers as it provides information on the internal structure of a star, and thus on its size, mass, composition and even age.
In addition to asteroseismology, Matthews has other interests.
In 1987, he began studying Wolf-Rayet stars, which are stars that liberate colossal amounts of matter into space.
In 1992, he tackled the job of mapping solar spots on stars using Doppler imaging.
In 1994, he used open star clusters and groups of open star clusters to calibrate a scale for cosmological distances.
The year 1997 was a particularly significant year for Matthews.
In 2003, after six years of preparation, the MOST satellite was launched.
The satellite is the size and shape of a large suitcase, and is equipped with an ultra sensitive telescope that measures only 15 centimetres across.
Despite its small size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting tiny variations in the luminosity of stars caused by pulsations that shake their surface.
Since 2004, the discoveries made by Matthews and the MOST satellite regularly make the headlines in the media around the world.
In addition to his research activities, Matthews is constantly involved in all sorts of activities related to popularizing science: newspaper interviews, radio and television appearances, public conferences, telescope tours, supervising students in high school, evening courses, summer camps, work sponsorships, etc.
Particularly popular with young people, he received awards for excellence in teaching in 1999 and 2002.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jack Newton (1942- ) Known for his world famous photographs Jack Newton was born in 1942 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
He obtained a diploma in business administration during the 1970’s from Red River Community College and became manager for the stores Sears and Marks & Spencer.
His interest in astronomy began in 1954 at the age of 12.
Four years later, in 1958, he joined the Winnipeg Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
In 1969, he constructed a 32-centimetre telescope and installed it under a dome in his backyard.
He then started up an astrophotography section with the Winnipeg Centre and became the president from 1970 to 1972.
In 1973, Newton’s work required him to move to Toronto.
He began to test different film types for his photography work and one year later, in 1974, he published Astro Photography:
In 1975, he was elected president of the Toronto Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Still passionate about photography, he published An Introduction to CCD Astronomy and Deep Sky Objects:
A Photographic Guide for the Amateur in 1977.
In 1979, Newton moved again for work-related reasons, this time to Victoria in British Columbia.
He continued to pursue his astrophotography activities and became the president of the Victoria Centre from 1980 to 1981.
He wrote two books with Philip Teece:
Cambridge Deep-Sky Album in 1983, and The Guide to Amateur Astronomy in 1988.
From 1990 to 1991, he again became president of the Victoria Centre and, in 1995, he and Philip Teece wrote a second edition to their book The Guide to Amateur Astronomy.
In 1997, he joined forces with Terence Dickinson and published Splendors of the Universe:
Throughout his career as an amateur astronomer, Newton regularly contributed to the magazines Astronomy, Sky & Telescope and SkyNews, and his photographs could be found in many popular media magazines like Newsweek and Canadian Geographic, or in books like The Audubon Society Field Guide to the Night Sky.
One of his more ambitious trips was in 1986 when he headed a contingent of more than 300 people to see Halley’s comet over Peruvian skies!
Newton received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, the Ken Chilton Prize from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1978, the Amateur Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1988, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1989.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Damien Lemay (1943- ) An extraordinary amateur observer, he works at all levels to popularize amateur astronomy in Canada Damien Lemay was born in 1943 at Saint-Édouard de Lotbinière in Quebec.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in physics in 1966 from Laval University in Quebec, and became a telecommunications engineer for Québec-Téléphone (now TELUS-Québec).
Lemay made his first forays into astronomy around 1954 at the age of 11.
In 1962, he bought his first telescope, a 11.4-centimetre Tasco reflector that he still has today.
From 1971 to 1972, he used 7x50 binoculars to observe all the stars in the Norton Star Atlas, from the North Pole to -35° South.
In 1973, he took his first long-exposure photos during a guided tour over the night of May 26.
Astrophotography quickly became one of Lemay’s passions and he equipped himself, by the end of that same year, with a 20.3-centimetre Schmidt Cassegrain telescope.
Lemay was probably the first North American observer to see Nova Cygni in the sky in 1975.
A nova is a star that absorbs matter from a neighbouring star, which causes the new host to heat up and suddenly brighten.
It is a rare and spectacular event.
In 1977, he became the French editor of the National Newsletter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada; he would keep this position until 1989.
In 1978, Lemay began the daunting task of assembling a photographic atlas of the sky using his 14-centimetre Schmidt camera.
He completed the work in 1985 after taking 1,182 photographs.
