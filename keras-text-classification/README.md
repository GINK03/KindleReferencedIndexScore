# CNN-text-classification-keras

It is slightly simplified implementation of [Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in TensorFlow](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/) in Keras as functional api

# Requirements
- [python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [keras 1.0.2](http://keras.io/#installation)
- [tensorflow 0.8](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup)

# Traning
Run the below command and it will run for 100 epochs if you want change it just open [model.py](https://github.com/bhaveshoswal/CNN-text-classification-keras/blob/master/model.py)

`python model.py`

# For new data
you have rebuild the vocabulary and then train
